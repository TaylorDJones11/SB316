# Music Player with Subscription Form ðŸŽµ

This project demonstrates a simple music player interface with the functionality to display a subscription form after a specific song index is reached. The form collects user information (name, last name, email) and validates it before submission. During the display of the form, the navigation buttons of the music player are disabled.

## Features

- Plays a list of songs with basic controls (play, pause, previous, next).
- Displays a subscription form after the third song index.
- Validates user inputs (name, last name, email) using regular expressions.
- Disables music player navigation buttons when the form is displayed.
- Submits the form upon valid input and resumes music playback.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS (for styling)
- JavaScript (for functionality)
